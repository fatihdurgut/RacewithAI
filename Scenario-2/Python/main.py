# Scenario 2: Implementing a small feature in an existing codebase
# You can run the code by 'pthon main.py' command in terminal.

# Task 1: Implement a function called 'calculate_factorial' to calculate the factorial of a given number.
# Task 2: Add a new function that calculates the sum of the factorials of a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

def calculate_factorial(n):
    # Implement this function
    pass

def main():
    print(calculate_factorial(5))  # Should print 120

main()
